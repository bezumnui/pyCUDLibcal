# Interactive Library Room Reservation for CUD HUB Campus

Welcome to the Interactive Library Room Reservation project for CUD HUB Campus!

This project allows you to reserve library rooms interactively based on the internal API of CUD HUB's reservation system.

## Overview

So far, the functionality provided is basic, allowing users to interact with the library reservation system (accessible via [CUD HUB Campus Reservation](https://cud.libcal.com/reserve)) and make room reservations.

### How it Works

This project works by sniffing the internal API of the CUD HUB reservation system to provide automated interaction with the library's room reservation platform.

## Features

- Interactive room reservation through CUD HUB Campus library system.
- Based on internal API sniffing, allowing for efficient interaction with the backend.
- Simple and clean Python code (everything you need is in the `main.py` file).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `main.py` file.
3. Customize the code (if needed) based on your requirements.
4. Run the script to interact with the reservation system.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Additional libraries: [aiohttp]

## Notes

This is an early-stage example project. The functionality is basic and intended for use in understanding how the reservation system can be interacted with programmatically. Improvements and enhancements will be made over time.
